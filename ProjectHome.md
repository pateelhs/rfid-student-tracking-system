The project focuses on automation of tasks regarding academia and concerning the student’s physical presence within the campus area e.g. class attendance, examination/student authentication etc. The intended automation is to be achieved using Radio-frequency identification (RFID) using radio frequency identification chips having unique identification and their scanners/antennas. All the data collected by the above mentioned method will be stored for further processing eliminating the possibility of human element in keeping a track of student’s physical presence.
